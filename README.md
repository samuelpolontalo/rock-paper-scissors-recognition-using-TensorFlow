# rock-paper-scissors-recognition-using-TensorFlow
In this data science project we will create program neural network that will recognize rock-paper-scissor hand shape using Tensor Flow.

You can download dataset that we use in this project [here](https://dicodingacademy.blob.core.windows.net/picodiploma/ml_pemula_academy/rockpaperscissors.zip).
In this dataset all images rock, paper and scissor only have green background.

here rock, paper and scissor picture example:
